# Bryce Harper & Ticket Prices

In February of 2019, with Spring Training already begun, Bryce Harper, perhaps the biggest free agent of the 2018-2019 offseason, remains unsigned.
Currently, rumors indicate that the Philadelphia Philles are a strong contender.  Other teams in the mix are the Dodgers, Giants, Padres, and Nationals, to varying degrees.

The question I am looking at is how will Harper's decision influence ticket prices for the 2019 season.  I used the Seatgeek API to pull the median ticket price for every Washington Nationals game as of February 2019, before any Bryce Harper decision has been announced.
