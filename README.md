# Bryce Harper & Ticket Prices

In February of 2019, with Spring Training already begun, Bryce Harper, perhaps the biggest free agent of the 2018-2019 offseason, remains unsigned.
Currently, rumors indicate that the Philadelphia Philles are a strong contender.  Other teams in the mix are the Dodgers, Giants, Padres, and Nationals, to varying degrees.

The question I am looking at is how will Harper's decision influence ticket prices for the 2019 season.  I used the Seatgeek API to pull the median ticket price for every Washington Nationals, Philadelphia Phillies, and LA Dodgers game as of February 2019, before any Bryce Harper decision has been announced.

As of February 2019, pre-Bryce Harper Decision Day, this is how ticket prices look for the 2019 season:
